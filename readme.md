# SpaceY Expanded

by NecroBones

Parts Pack

An expansion pack for the SpaceY Heavy Lifters mod. **This pack requires both Module Manager, and SpaceY Heavy Lifters to be installed as dependencies.**

Adds 7.5m parts, plus additional engines, accessories, and other parts that go beyond the original stated purpose of SpaceY Heavy Lifters.

**Cooperates with other mods:**

- [TweakScale](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80234)
- [FAR / NEAR](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86419)
- [AVC](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745) (Add-on Version Checker)

### Part of the NecroBones suite of mods, that work nicely together:

- Modular Rocket Systems (stock-alike parts pack, NASA-like alternatives, and filling the gaps)
- SpaceY Heavy Lifters Parts Pack (stock-balanced large rocket parts, 5m parts, large SRBs)
- Color Coded Canisters (replacement models/textures for stock fuel tanks: prettier, cleaner, and diameter color-coding for the tank end-caps)
- Fuel Tanks Plus (collection of large stock-like tanks with Color Coded Canister style)
- ColorFuel Lines (color-selctable fuel lines)
- Lithobrake Exploration Technologies (lander parts, large chutes/legs/ladders/etc)

### Design Goals

Provide some new visual styles, to dress up the booster sections of your rockets.
Help mildly reduce part count and wobble, by providing larger tanks.
Be as memory efficient as possible. Each diameter has a shared texture to keep memory usage low.
Follow the same colors and artistic style established in Color Coded Canisters.
