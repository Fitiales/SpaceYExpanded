0.6 (2015-10-01) - Beta.
 - Adjusted P-series (Penguin) engines back to 400 ISP by default.
 - Added MM config for Penguin engines to detect CryoEngines and make the following tweaks:
    - Reduces Liquid-Fuel ISP to 360.
    - Adds mode switching, with alternate Liquid-Hydrogen mode, with slightly better ISP but slightly worse thrust.
 - Added a miniscule gimbal range to Penguin engines (previously they were non-vectoring). 
 - Significantly increased connection breaking strength on most parts (including all 7.5m parts).

0.5.1 (2015-09-23) - Beta.
 - Adjusted P-series (Penguins) vacuum ISP to 390. Work in progress. :)
 - Fixed a problem with the 7.5m tanks (and 5m tanks) working properly with Modular Fuel Tanks.

0.5 (2015-09-23) - Beta.
 - Fixed an issue with some parts not being able to show up in CTT's tech tree. Requires SpaceY-Lifters v1.0.4 to be effective.
 - Corrected the names of the README and this CHANGELOG to reflect that it's the Expanded version of the mod.
 - Reduced P-series (Penguins) vacuum ISP to 380 (down from 400).

0.4 (2015-09-11) - Alpha/Beta.
 - Added 7.5m service bay.
 - Corrected the 3.75m and 5m service bays to have "No Attach" flag for door colliders.
 - Reduced the size of the flag decal on the 5m service bay.

0.3 (2015-09-10) - Alpha/Beta.
 - Added service bays: 3.75m, 5m
 - Fixed a typo in the TweakScale config.

0.2 (2015-09-04) - Alpha/Beta
 - Increased the 1-atmosphere ISP of the Penguin (vacuum) engines to 250, up from 100.
 - Changed the E1 engine's thrust vector location to aid in clipping engines.
 - Added fueled 7.5m nose cone.
 - 7.5m to 5m adapter tank more than doubled in capacity, cost, etc (was underpowered for its size)
    - Also added it to the Modular Fuel Tanks config.
 - Added an additional shorter 7.5m to 5m adapter tank with checkered paint scheme.
 - Added non-fueled 7.5m to 5m adapter.
 - Added an upper-stage capable 7.5m "Dual-Emu" engine.

0.1 (2015-09-02) - Initial Alpha test version. 
 - Requires ModuleManager and SpaceY-Lifters as dependencies.
