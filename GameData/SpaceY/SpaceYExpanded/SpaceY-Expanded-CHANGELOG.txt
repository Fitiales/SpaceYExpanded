1.1.4 (2016-01-14) - Tweaks.
 - Removed the tech tree nodes, since they've been moved to SpaceY Lifters (requires SpaceY Lifters 1.8.2+).

1.1.3 (2016-01-11) - Fixes.
 - CryoEngines fix: The Penguin engines should no longer display their default plume effects even when not running.

1.1.2 (2016-01-02) - Fixes.
 - CryoEngines fix: The Penguin engines should no longer run more than one engine mode at once.

1.1.1 (2016-01-02) - Fixes.
 - Included ModuleManager version updated with its 2.6.16 bugfix update.
 - Added a "needs" condition for TweakScale patches.

1.1 (2015-12-31) - Texture Compatibility.
 - Removed 7.5m fuel tank texture, since it was moved to SpaceY Lifters.
    - Repointed all necessary texture assignments to the new location.
    - Adjusted UV-mapping of 5m texture as needed to corrospond to changes in Lifters.
 - Changed "ModularFuelTanks" config to also apply if RealFuels is installed.

1.0 (2015-12-17) - Stable.
 - Let's call this the 1.0 release. Things have been pretty stable lately.
 - Added "SpaceY_ATM.cfg" with settings to attempt to disable or dissuade ActiveTextureManagement for this mod.
    - Can optionally be deleted to return to ATM defaults.
    - ATM known to occasionally have caching issues with remapped/shared textures in my mods.
    - SpaceY is already very memory efficient and uses DDS, so ATM doesn't help much for this case.
    - May need to delete ATM's cache if using ATM and some textures still aren't appearing.
 - Updated 7.5m stack decoupler:
    - Ejection charge reduced by half (to 500, down from 1000).
    - Added built-in "sepratron" solid propellant separator motors.
    - Research cost increased slightly.
 - Replaced "placeholder" textures. Smaller, and more obvious when texture reassignment has failed.
 - Corrected a texture assignment problem on the 7.5m E2 engine.

0.9 (2015-11-11) - KSP 1.0.5 update.
 - Corrected the display-name of the "Gigantic Structure" tech node, instead of displaying it as a second "Massive Structure" node.
 - Diameters added to 7.5m fuel tank names, for easy identification in VAB menu.
 - Updated heat shield to current stock ablator settings and contract constraints. Slightly increased ablator quantity.
 - Updated all engines to use FXModuleAnimateThrottle for heat animation.
 - Engines, fairings, decouplers/separators updated to use new stock-alike thermal settings and contract constraints.
 - Lightened the color and "grain" of the white texture on fuel tanks (will also affect 5m tanks).

0.8 (2015-10-16) - Beta, engine updates.
 - Adjusted R9 engine HotRockets config to correspond to SpaceY Lifters' fixes (as of Lifters v1.3).
 - R9 engine now uses custom default engine effects from SpaceY Lifters (requires Lifters v1.3+).
 - R9 engine now uses new engine bell art assets from SpaceY Lifters 1.3+.
 - New default custom particle effects for LFO engines (E,P series).

0.7 (2015-10-09) - Beta.
 - Corrected the cross-section profile on several parts (mainly Emu engines and decoupler/separators).
 - Fuel tanks now have multiple paint schemes, selectable if InterstellarFuelSwitch or Firespitter are installed.
    - Known issue: Will have nasty z-fighting with all paint schemes at once, if something tricks ModuleManager about Interstelar/Firespitter installed state. Might have to delete ModuleManager config cache.

0.6.1 (2015-10-02) - Tweaks.
 - Moved some engine mod-support to their own MM config files:
    - CryoEngines
    - EngineIgnitor
 - Adjusted the Penguin engines' CryoEngines-triggered ISPs upward for both fuel modes.
 - Added 7.5m stack separator.

0.6 (2015-10-01) - Beta.
 - Adjusted P-series (Penguin) engines back to 400 ISP by default.
 - Added MM config for Penguin engines to detect CryoEngines and make the following tweaks:
    - Reduces Liquid-Fuel ISP to 360.
    - Adds mode switching, with alternate Liquid-Hydrogen mode, with slightly better ISP but slightly worse thrust.
 - Added a minuscule gimbal range to Penguin engines (previously they were non-vectoring). 
 - Significantly increased connection breaking strength on most parts (including all 7.5m parts).

0.5.1 (2015-09-23) - Beta.
 - Adjusted P-series (Penguins) vacuum ISP to 390. Work in progress. :)
 - Fixed a problem with the 7.5m tanks (and 5m tanks) working properly with Modular Fuel Tanks.

0.5 (2015-09-23) - Beta.
 - Fixed an issue with some parts not being able to show up in CTT's tech tree. Requires SpaceY-Lifters v1.0.4 to be effective.
 - Corrected the names of the README and this CHANGELOG to reflect that it's the Expanded version of the mod.
 - Reduced P-series (Penguins) vacuum ISP to 380 (down from 400).

0.4 (2015-09-11) - Alpha/Beta.
 - Added 7.5m service bay.
 - Corrected the 3.75m and 5m service bays to have "No Attach" flag for door colliders.
 - Reduced the size of the flag decal on the 5m service bay.

0.3 (2015-09-10) - Alpha/Beta.
 - Added service bays: 3.75m, 5m
 - Fixed a typo in the TweakScale config.

0.2 (2015-09-04) - Alpha/Beta
 - Increased the 1-atmosphere ISP of the Penguin (vacuum) engines to 250, up from 100.
 - Changed the E1 engine's thrust vector location to aid in clipping engines.
 - Added fueled 7.5m nose cone.
 - 7.5m to 5m adapter tank more than doubled in capacity, cost, etc (was underpowered for its size)
    - Also added it to the Modular Fuel Tanks config.
 - Added an additional shorter 7.5m to 5m adapter tank with checkered paint scheme.
 - Added non-fueled 7.5m to 5m adapter.
 - Added an upper-stage capable 7.5m "Dual-Emu" engine.

0.1 (2015-09-02) - Initial Alpha test version. 
 - Requires ModuleManager and SpaceY-Lifters as dependencies.
