	// Parts\Control
		#SYE-vernier1-titl = SpaceY V1 Vernier Thruster

These motors are linked to RCS controls, but are powered by a Fuel+Oxidizer mix, making them significantly more powerful than MonoPropellant-powered RCS thrusters.

		#SYE-engine7mR9-desc = Designed purely for lifting power, this cluster of nine R1 "Ratites" will attain some of the best thrust to payload-weight ratios available with current technology. However, it will cost you in fuel efficiency, and the engine itself is quite massive. Only suitable as a lower-stage engine.
